## Description
Capstone Project for Week 5, Android at Epicodus.
This is a flashcard/quiz type app to help the user learn who's who among US & World leaders.

## Technologies Used
Java, Android Studio, Firebase Authentication

## Known Issues
* No landscape layouts
* Does not persist question when rotated

## Future Enhancements
* Add more people
    * Heads of State (about 2-400)
    * Senators (almost done...)
    * Governors (50)
    * Congressional Representatives (400+)
    * Ambassadors (to and from the US)

* Add levels of difficulty
  * At this point the number of people in the list represent the difficulty. It will start with level 1 having a small set of people (12-24?) and automatically adding another set when they reach a certain level of success (for example getting all 100% on the high scores). The level information will be stored on the phone.

* Post scores/level promotions to social media with link to play store app

* Put the app on the play store.
